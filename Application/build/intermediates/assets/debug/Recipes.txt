Instructions:
Preparing the cookies dough � 10 minutes + waiting time
If you use butter right out of your fridge, cut it into small pieces before adding it to the standmixer bowl. MIX peanut butter, butter and vegetable oil on low-speed until you�ve reached a smooth mixture. This only takes a few minutes.

Gradually ADD sugar and brown sugar, keep on mixing until you�ve reached a smooth, light and fluffy mixture. ADD the egg and vanilla extract and again, mix well.

COMBINE flour, salt and baking soda and add gradually to the smooth peanut butter mixture. COVER the cookie dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. The dough will become firm, so you can easily form the cookies.

PRE-HEAT the oven to 190 degrees celsius or 350 degrees fahrenheit.

Baking the peanut butter cookies � 15 minutes
When the dough has become firm in the refrigerator, you can now use your hands to create small cookie balls. PLACE them onto the baking tray lined with parchment paper and use a fork to press the cookie balls downwards. DIP the fork in water to prevent the cookie from sticking to the fork and create a crisscross pattern with the fork. You can now decide how thick you like the cookies.

BAKE the cookies for about 10 minutes, or until lightly browned on the edges.

Let them cool of on the baking tray for a few minutes, they will become firm in those minutes so don�t worry! TRANSFER them to a cooling rack and wait until they�re cooled off enough. Stored in an airtight container, you can store them up to 5 days.

Instructions:

**Note: this dough requires chill time!**
1. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
2. Cream butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add molasses and mix until mixture is smooth. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until combined. Mix in baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and flour. Mix until a smooth dough forms. The dough will be very soft. Chill dough for 30-45 minutes, or until you can handle it without it sticking too much to your hands.
3. Scoop 2 tablespoon balls of dough. Place a candy in the center and wrap the dough over it, rolling between your hands to form a ball. Make sure the candy is not showing. (Alternately, you could scoop two 1-tablespoon sized balls of dough, sandwich the candy, and roll into a ball. Do whichever method you prefer.) Place cookie dough balls on prepared cookie sheet. You don�t need to space them out at this point, they�re getting chilled again.
4. Chill dough for at least 2 hours.
5. Preheat oven to 350�F or 190�C. Line a second cookie sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat. Split cookie dough balls evenly between the cookie sheets. These will spread, so I only put two per line. Place any leftover dough balls back in the refrigerator to chill until you�re ready to bake them.
6. Bake cookies for 11-14 minutes, until they are no longer glossy in the center and the bottoms are just getting golden brown. I like to err on the side of underdone cookies, but that�s preference. Bake them towards the longer side if you like your cookies baked more.
7. Cool completely before removing from cookie sheets. Store in an airtight container for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 2 months.

3. Add about one tablespoon of the apple filling on top of each circle of pie dough.
4. In a medium bowl, mix flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, oats, and salt. Add melted butter and mix until well incorporated.
5. Add a heaping tablespoon of the streusel topping to each muffin well, and gently pat it down over the apples.
6. Bake for 17-19 minutes. **Allow the apple pie cookies to cool in the muffin tin for at least 10-15 minutes before removing.** I like to use a dull knife to gently remove them from the tin. Cool on a wire rack

Soft and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

Class:

Difficulty:

Ingredients:
Butter
170
Brown Sugar
55
Sugar
165
Egg(s)
1
Vanilla Extract
1
Baking Soda
1
Flour
256
Chocolate Chips
2

Instructions:

1. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) combine the butter, sugars, egg, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.
2. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, pudding mix, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.
3. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the chocolate chips, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.
4. Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 14 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip - Strategically place a few chocolate chips right on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top.
5. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.
6. Preheat oven to 165C, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 11 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack.
7. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Instructions:
For filling
1. Mix all ingredients and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens (5-8 minutes). 
2. Extra sugar or lemon juice may be added depending on your own taste.
3. Place a plastic wrap touching the surface so it won't create a "skin" and refrigerate until needed.
For batter
1. Process almond meal in a blender or food processor to make it thinner.
2. Sift flour and confectioner's sugar , mix and make a little hole in the center.
3. Pour the whites 82g folding in the batter. Set aside.
4. In an electric mixer, beat the remaining 90g of whites until soft peaks form. Meanwhile, bring water and sugar to a boil to form a syrup. Once you reach 230 F (110 C) turn off the stove.
5. Incorporate syrup little by little in the whites while the mixer is running. If you are using a hand mixer try holding the pan with one hand and the mixer with the other.
6. With the mixer on high let it mix for five minutes or until the meringue is shinny and stiff peaks form. Meringue will be elastic and the bowl should cool slightly.
7. Add a few drops of food coloring while the mixer is running.
8. Fold in, 1/3 of the meringue flour mixture gently being careful to not lose the air incorporated.
9. Add in another 1/3 of meringue and finally the last part. Batter shouldn't be too firm or too loose. To make sure you got the right consistency, drop a little bit of batter in a plate and wait. Batter should loose its shape within 10 seconds.
10. Place the dough in a pastry bag and pipe in small circles, leaving a space of 1 inch between them.
11. Bake in preheated oven at 350 f (180 C) for 8-10 minutes or until the top is shiny and crisp. Let cool completely and then untold.
12. Put lemon curd in a pipping bag and fill the center of cookies. Sandwich them together and they're ready to eat. They last for up to 6 days without filling or four days filled and chilled.

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 215 degrees celsius. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat mat.
2. Add the eggs whites to a medium bowl (or the bowl of an electric mixer). Using the whisk attachment, whisk eggs on low speed. They should start to foam.
3. Add the cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla.
4. Increase speed to medium. Begin to add the sugar, a little bit at a time whisking well between each addition. The mixture will start to form soft peaks. Gradually increase the speed to medium-high and continue to slowly add the sugar. Be patient. The mixture will continue to stiffen.
5. Once the mixture has formed stiff peaks (where you dip a spoon in an the peak is able to stay sticking straight up), gently fold in the chopped pistachios and chocolate, saving a little bit of each to sprinkle on the top.
6. Dollop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared pan. The larger they are, the longer they will need to bake. Sprinkle the remaining pistachios and chocolate on top of the meringues.
7. Bake for 60-90 minutes depending on the size of the meringues. I was able to get about 20 meringues out of the batter and baked them for 85 minutes. When fully baked, you should be able to lift the meringue off of the baking pan without it breaking.
8. Turn off the oven, crack open the door, and let the meringues cool in the oven completely.
9. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

Difficulty:

Ingredients:
Bread Flour
408
Instant Yeast
0.25
Salt
1.25

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees F.
2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.
3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.
4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

2. In a separate jug add in the milk, water, honey and butter. Heat it in the microwave until it is warm (at blood temperature) and the butter has melted. Whisk in the eggs quickly.
3. Stir the wet into the dry to make a sticky dough. You can simply mix with a spoon until there are no flour lumps yet. Scrape down the dough from the sides of the bowl.
4. Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise for 2 hours at cool room temperature. It will triple in size
5. After this, REFRIGERATE THE DOUGH FOR AT LEAST 8 HOURS, preferrably over night. It can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before using.
6. When you're ready to make your cinnamon rolls, make the filling. Combine the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir until smooth. Set aside.
7. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface, and roll it into a rectangle approximately �-inch thick. It will be long so you can always do it in 2 goes.
8. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a narrow margin around the edges uncovered.
9. Starting with a long edge, gently roll the dough into a log. Don't roll it too tightly; if you do, the centers of the buns will pop up as they bake.
10. Slice the rolls 2� thick and set them with their cinnamon face up
11. In a deep baking pan lined with parchment space the buns in the pan.
12. (AT THIS POINT YOU CAN REFRIGERATE TO BAKE OFF THE FOLLOWING DAY IF YOU WISH)
13. Cover the pan, and allow the rolls to rise until they're have grown into each other and are puffed up, about 30-1 hour. (depending on how hot your kitchen is)
14. (Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375oF/ 190oC)
15. Uncover the pan, and bake the buns for 40 to 45 minutes, till they're a deep golden brown. Rotate the tray during baking so they can get golden brown all over.
16. While they are baking make your glaze: In a large bowl (or you can use a hand mixer) beat the cream cheese, butter, sugar and vanilla together with a whisk until well combined.
17. Remove the pan from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes. Once cooled remove from the pan and onto a cooling rack .
18. Spread your cream cheese glaze generously over the cinnamon rolls, and devour immediately,

Instant Yeast
4.5
Egg(s)
3
Sugar

Milk
30
Sugar
200
Ground Cinnamon
9
Melted Butter
2

Instructions:
1. Warm the milk in a small sauce pan on the stove until it just starts to bubble, stirring occasionally.
2. Remove from heat.
3. Let cool until lukewarm, about 120-125 degrees.
4. Dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside until yeast is frothy, about 10 minutes or so (make sure your water is at the correct temperature or the yeast won't activate.) Then mix in eggs, sugar, butter salt and raisins (stir in the cooled milk slowly so you don't cook the eggs.) Add the flour gradually to make a stiff dough.
5. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for a few minutes until smooth.
6. Place in a large, buttered, mixing bowl and turn to grease the surface of the dough.
7. Cover with a warm, damp cloth and let rise (I like to let my bread rise in the oven with the light on. It has just the right amount of heat and keeps the bread out of drafts.) Allow to rise until doubled, usually about 1 1/2 hours.
8. Roll out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle 1/2 inch thick.
9. Moisten the dough with 2 tablespoons milk and rub all over the dough with your hands.
10. Mix together 1 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons cinnamon and sprinkle mixture evenly on top of the moistened dough.
11. Roll up tightly (the long way).
12. The roll should be about 3 inches in diameter.
13. Cut into thirds, and tuck under ends and pinch bottom together.
14. Place loaves into well greased (you can use Crisco or butter for this) 9 x 5 inch pans and lightly grease tops of loaves.
15. Let rise in warm place, uncovered, again for about an hour.
16. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until loaves are lightly browned and sound hollow when tapped.
17. Remove from oven and let cool on rack.
18. Take melted butter and spread over tops of loaves.
19. After about 20 minutes, lay loaves on their sides and remove from pans.
20. Allow to cool before slicing.

Brioche

Difficulty:

Butter

Instructions:
1. One day or up to 2 days ahead, make the dough. In the mixer bowl, place the water, sugar, instant yeast, flour, and egg. Whisk by hand until very smooth, to incorporate air, about 3 minutes. The sponge will be the consistency of a very thick batter. (At first the dough may collect inside the whisk, but just shake it out and keep whisking. If it's too thick to whisk, it means you've added too much flour and will need to add a little of the eggs to be added Step 3.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl and set it aside, covered with plastic wrap.
2. Combine the ingredients for the flour mixture and add to the sponge. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the sugar and yeast. Then whisk in the salt (this keeps the yeast from coming in contact with the salt, which would kill it). Sprinkle this mixture on top of the sponge. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it stand for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature. (During this time, the sponge will bubble through the flour mixture in places; this is fine.)
3. Mix the dough. Add the 2 cold eggs and mix with the dough hook on low (#2 if using a KitchenAid) for about 1 minute or until the flour is moistened. Raise the speed to medium (#4 KitchenAid) and beat for 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl with an oiled spatula and continue beating for about 5 minutes longer or until the dough is smooth and shiny but very soft and sticky. It will mass around the dough hook but not pull away from the bowl completely.
Add the butter by the tablespoon, waiting until each addition is almost completely absorbed before adding the next tablespoon, beating until all the butter is incorporated. The dough will be very soft and elastic and will stick to your fingers unmercifully, but don't be tempted to add more flour at this point; it will firm considerably after chilling. (The dough will weigh about 19 ounces/536 grams.)
4. Let the dough rise. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a 1-quart dough rising container or bowl, greased lightly with cooking spray or oil. Lightly spray or oil the top of the dough and cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approximately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
5. Chill the dough. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour to firm it; this will prevent the butter from separating. Gently deflate the dough by stirring it with a rubber scraper or spatula, and return it to the refrigerator for another hour so that it will be less sticky and easier to handle.
6. Deflate the dough and allow it to rest, chilled. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and press or roll it into a rectangle, flouring the surface and dough as needed to keep it from sticking. The exact size of the rectangle is not important. Give the dough a business letter turn, brushing off any excess flour, and again press down or roll it out into a rectangle. Rotate it 90 degrees so that the closed side is facing to your left. Give it a second business letter turn and round the corners. Dust it lightly on all sides with flour. Wrap it loosely but securely in plastic wrap and then place it in a large zip-seal bag. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days to allow the dough to ripen (develop flavor) and firm.
7. Shape the dough and let it rise. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and gently press it down to deflate it. Cut the dough into 16 pieces (a scant 1 1/4 ounces/33 grams each). Without a scale, the easiest way to divide the dough evenly is to lightly flour your hands and roll it into a long cylinder. Cut it in half, then continue cutting each piece in half until there are 16 pieces.
Pinch off a little less than one-quarter of each piece, for the topknot. Roll each larger piece of dough into a ball and press it into a prepared brioche mold. With lightly floured hands, shape each of the dough pieces reserved for the topknots into an elongated pear form. Using your index finger, make a hole in the center of each brioche, going almost to the bottom of the mold, and insert the elongated part of a topknot deeply into the hole. Cover the molds loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let rise (ideally at 75� to 80�F) until the edges of the dough reach the tops of the molds, about 1 hour. (See page 493 for step-by-step illustrations.)
8. Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 425�F 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lower level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it before preheating.
9. Glaze and bake the brioche. Lightly beat together the 1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon of cream for the glaze. Brush the top of the brioche with the egg glaze, being careful not to drip any on the side of the pans, or it will impede rising. Allow it to dry for 5 minutes and then brush a second time with the glaze. Use greased scissors or a small sharp knife to make a 1/4-inch-deep cut all around the base of the topknot so it will rise to an attractive shape.
Set the molds on a baking sheet and place them on the hot stone or hot baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted under a topknot comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 190�F).
10. Cool the brioche. Remove the brioche from the oven and unmold them onto a wire rack. Turn top side up and allow them to cool until barely warm.

Instructions:
Make meringue layers:
1. Preheat oven to 275�F.
2. Draw 3 (14- by 3-inch) rectangles, about 3/4 inch apart, on parchment. Turn paper over (rectangles will be visible) and put it on a lightly buttered large baking sheet.
3. Beat whites with a pinch of salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they hold soft peaks. Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, then increase speed to high and continue beating until whites hold stiff glossy peaks, about 4 minutes with a standing mixer or 8 to 10 minutes with a handheld. Transfer meringue to pastry bag fitted with 1/3-inch tip and fill in rectangles completely. Gently smooth tops, then bake in middle of oven until firm and very pale golden, 45 to 60 minutes. Slide meringue layers (on parchment) onto a large rack. Cool completely, then carefully peel off parchment.
Make mousse while meringues bake:
1. Melt butter with cornstarch, passion-fruit pulp, and 3/4 cup sugar in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
2. Whisk together whole egg and yolks in a large bowl until combined, then add butter mixture in a stream, whisking. Transfer mixture to saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, whisking constantly, until thick enough to hold mark of whisk and first bubble appears on surface, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer curd immediately to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, until cold.
3. Beat cream with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold 2 cups whipped cream into curd gently but thoroughly to form a mousse (for filling and icing).
4. Transfer 3/4 cup whipped cream to a small bowl and reserve, chilled, for cream layer. Fold 1/2 cup mousse into remaining whipped cream, then transfer to cleaned pastry bag fitted with 1/8-inch tip and reserve, chilled, for decorative icing.
5. Assemble cake and freeze:
6. Arrange 1 meringue layer, flat side down, on platter and spread evenly with 3/4 cup mousse. Cover with another meringue layer and spread evenly with reserved whipped cream. Cover with remaining meringue layer, flat side up, and spread remaining mousse evenly over top and sides of cake, smoothing with a cake spatula. Pipe icing decoratively on top of cake, then freeze, uncovered, until firm, at least 3 hours.
7. About 1 hour before serving, put cake in refrigerator to soften slightly.

Instructions:
16 teaspoons of Cocoa Powder is equivalent to 40g.

1. Grease and line a 33x23cm/13x9in Swiss roll tin with baking parchment. Cut a sheet of baking silicone to fit the base of the Swiss roll tin. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and lay the silicone sheet on top.
2. For the decorative paste, cream the butter and icing sugar together until light and fluffy. Gradually add the egg whites, beating continuously. Fold in the flour and cocoa powder until combined.
3. Spread the paste thinly and evenly over the silicon mat using a palette knife. Drag a pastry comb diagonally through the paste to form a pinstripe pattern, scraping off the excess mixture after each drag. Place the paste in the freezer for 15 minutes.
4. For the joconde sponge, preheat the oven to 220C/200C(fan)/Gas 7.
5. Whisk the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Add the caster sugar, one teaspoon at a time, whisking between each addition to make a glossy meringue. Cover with cling film and set aside.
6. Tip the ground almonds and icing sugar into the bowl of a freestanding mixer and add the whole eggs. Whisk together for 3-5 minutes, or until doubled in volume. Fold in the flour, and then gently fold in the meringue in three separate batches. Pour the melted butter down the side of the bowl and fold in, until incorporated.
7. Remove the silicone sheet with the decorative paste from the freezer and place into the base of the lined Swiss roll tin.
8. Tip the joconde sponge mixture over the pinstripe paste and level the surface with a palette knife. Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until pale, golden-brown and springy to touch.
9. Place a sheet of baking parchment over a cooling rack and turn the cake out onto it. Peel off the baking parchment and silicon sheet from the base of the cake and leave to cool completely.
10. Line the sides of 6 x 6.5cm/2�in chefs� rings with baking parchment. Cut a rectangular template measuring 17x5cm/6�x2in, from a piece of parchment paper.
11. When the sponge is cooled, trim the edges and cut out six rectangles of sponge using the template. Wrap the cake strips inside the cake rings, stripey side facing out. Once wrapped inside the rings, gently push and press the ends to meet together to make a seamless cake. You want the joconde to fit very tightly pressed up to the sides of the cake rings.
12. Using a small 4cm/1�in round cutter, cut out small circles from the cake trimmings and push them into the base of the cake rings.
13. For the dark chocolate mousse, place the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water (ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water). Melt slowly and do not allow the chocolate become too hot. ?
14. Stir in the butter and mix until combined. Add the egg yolks and brandy and set aside to cool a little.
15. In a bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold into the chocolate mixture until completely incorporated.
16. Whip the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold into the chocolate and egg white mixture.
17. Spoon the mousse into a disposable piping bag and pipe into the cake lined rings, until the mousse comes three-quarters of the way up the sponge. Chill them in the freezer while you make the white chocolate mousse.
18. For the white chocolate mousse, place the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water). Melt very gently, but do not allow the chocolate to become too hot. ?
19. In a bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold into the white chocolate mixture.
20. In a bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed and fold into the white chocolate mixture.
21. Spoon the white chocolate mousse into a disposable piping bag and pipe on top of the chocolate mousse until it reaches the top of the cake rings. Chill in the fridge until set.
22. Once set, turn out of the cake rings and place on serving plates. Top with the raspberries and blueberries and dust with icing sugar.

Instructions:
1 In a small, heavy saucepan bring the heavy whipping cream to a simmer (stir and scrape down the sides with a spatula every few minutes).
If you are using one of the other recommended flavorings, stir it in with the cream (and ignore vanilla in the next step). If adding mint or other solids, after the cream simmers, remove from heat and let seep for an hour. Then strain away solids, and return the cream to a simmer and proceed with recipe.
2 Place the chocolate in a separate bowl. Pour the cream over the chocolate, add the vanilla, and allow to stand for a few minutes then stir until smooth. (This chocolate base is called ganache.)
3 Allow to cool, then place in the refrigerator for two hours. Remove and with a teaspoon roll out balls of the ganache. Roll in your hands quickly (as it will melt from the heat of your hands) and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the refrigerator overnight.
4 Roll in cocoa powder or chopped nuts and serve, or place back in the refrigerator until needed.

4. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Pour into prepared pan. Cool completely.
5. Place chopped chocolate in a heat-proof mixing bowl.
6. Heat the cream in a microwave safe Pyrex measuring cup until very hot (just shy of boiling). Pour the cream through a sieve into the bowl with chocolate. Let it for a few minutes, then whisk cream and chocolates together until the chocolate is completely melted. Whisk in the rum, coffee, and vanilla. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
7. Cut � teaspoon pieces of caramel and form into balls (make about 30 to start). Scoop out 2 teaspoons of chocolate mixture and form a ball around each caramel ball. (Roll between your two palms---your hands will get messy!). Repeat until all chocolate is used. You will have leftover caramel (cut into squares, wrap in wax paper and store in refrigerator or freezer).
8. Roll truffles in cocoa powder and store in refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving so caramel centers have time to soften.

Instructions:
1. Firstly get everything ready because once the sugar syrup is at the right temperature you need to be a ready to move quickly.
2. Place your egg whites into the bowl of an electric stand mixer (you can use a hand mixer but you will probably need someone to assist you). Line a tray with non-stick baking paper, put some water into a cup with your pastry brush and have your candy thermometer ready.
3. Place the sugar, glucose syrup and honey into a saucepan and stir until the sugar was dissolved. Wash down the sides of the pan using a pastry brush. Turn on the beater and whip the egg whites to soft peaks.
4. Using a candy thermometer monitor the sugar syrup temperature until it reaches 250�F (120�C). Remove from the heat, turn on the mixers and add three soup ladles full into the egg whites.
5. Leave the mixers running and return the pan to the heat. Continue to heat until it reaches 300�F (150�C) then immediately pour into the egg white mixture in a steady stream. It will start to get very thick, add the fruit and nuts and quickly pour onto the lined baking tray.
6. If you want flat bars place another sheet of non-stick baking paper over the top and use rolling pin to smooth out. Once it is cold, turn out and peel off the paper. Using a sharp knife and a lot of muscles push down and rock back and forth on the knife to force it through the candy.
7. Store in an airtight container with non-stick paper on the base and between the layers of nougat.

Sugar
450
Vanilla Extract

Olive Oil
1
Icing Sugar

Instructions:
1. Place the gelatine and 100ml/3�fl oz of cold water into a bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes, or until softened.
2. Meanwhile, pour the sugar and 175ml/6fl oz of cold water into a heavy-based saucepan and bring to a rolling boil on a medium to high heat, stirring continuously, until the sugar dissolves.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture gently for 15-20 minutes, until a sugar thermometer dipped into the mixture reads 113C/235F. (NB: At this temperature, the sugar syrup will have reached the soft-ball stage.) CAUTION: This mixture is extremely hot and can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.
4. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches the correct temperature, place the softened gelatine and water into the bowl of a food mixer and blend on its lowest setting. Gradually pour in the sugar syrup in a slow, steady stream, avoiding pouring the sugar syrup on the beaters as it may splash. Whisk continuously until all of the syrup has been fully incorporated in the mixture.
5. Add the vanilla extract, then increase the blending speed and blend for 18-20 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened, cooled and is beginning to set.
6. Meanwhile, grease a 20cm/8in square, deep-sided cake tin with some of the sunflower oil. Line the tin baking parchment and grease the paper with the remaining oil. Mix together the icing sugar and cornflour and dust the tin with a little of the mixture to evenly coat the base and sides. Reserve the remaining icing sugar and cornflour mixture for later.
7. Pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the surface with a palette knife or spatula that has been dipped in boiling water. Dust the top of the marshmallows with a little more of the icing sugar and cornflour mixture, then cover the tin with cling film and set aside in a cool, dry place for 1-2 hours or overnight to set. (NB: Do not chill in the fridge.)
8. Once the marshmallow mixture has set, turn out the marshmallow slab onto a clean work surface dusted with the remaining icing sugar and cornflour mixture. Peel off the parchment paper and cut the marshmallow into 36 cubes. Dredge the marshmallows in the icing sugar and cornflour mixture to coat, or coat one or more sides in the chopped nuts, flower petals or coloured sugar for decoration. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to three weeks.

Instructions:
1. Warm the milk in the saucepan until you start to see wisps of steam. It should not actually be boiling.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, and salt. 
3. Add the egg yolks and whisk them into the dry ingredients. This will form a thick paste. It's fine if the paste looks crumbly or smooth; the important thing is that the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
4. Add the milk to the egg mixture: Pour a little of the hot milk into the eggs and whisk to combine. 
5. Continue pouring the milk slowly into the eggs, whisking continuously. 
6. Pour everything back in the pan: When all the milk has been added to the eggs, pour everything back into the saucepan. 
7. Set a strainer over a bowl and place this near the stove.
8. Set the pan back over medium heat. Whisk constantly. At first, the pastry cream will look very thin and frothy, but it will start to thicken after a few minutes. 
9. When it has thickened to a pudding-like consistency, pause whisking every few seconds to see if the cream has come to a boil. 
10. If you see large bubbles popping on the surface, whisk for a few more seconds and then remove the pan from heat.
11. Strain and cool the pastry cream: Stir the vanilla into the pastry cream and then pour the cream into the strainer set over the bowl. 
12. Stir to push it through the strainer. This will catch any bits of cooked egg that may be in your pastry cream.
13. Cover the pastry cream with a piece of plastic wrap pressed right up against the surface of the cream and chill completely.
14. Fold whipped cream into the pastry cream when it's no longer piping hot, but not yet completely chilled.

Instructions:
1. Heat oven to 200C/400F. 
2. Roll out 250g of the pastry on a sheet of baking parchment to about 25cm square. 
3. Scatter over half the almonds, then press them in very gently, dust with half the icing sugar and lay over a second sheet of baking parchment. 
4. Lift onto a baking sheet, and sit another baking sheet on top like a sandwich. 
5. Fill a few small tins with baking beans (or something similarily heavy and ovenproof like raw rice). 
6. Bake for 30 mins, then have a quick peek � it will probably need another 5 mins to be well browned and crisp all over.
7. When done, remove from the oven, take off the weights and top baking tray, then carefully lift off the top sheet of parchment and leave to cool. 
8. Repeat with the remaining pastry � you can do both sheets at once if you have enough baking sheets and tins, but they might not cook as evenly with two in the oven, so it is safer to do one at a time. Cool both completely.
9. Put the remaining custard ingredients in a big saucepan. 
10. Set over a low heat to start, whisking continuously to mix well, then increase the heat a little until the custard is gently boiling. 
11. Keep whisking the whole time � the custard will thicken and lump unevenly, but keep cooking and whisking until it is smooth and very thick.
12. Remove the custard from the heat and remove the vanilla pod. Add gelatine powder into the cold water. Stir it into the custard until it has dissolved.
13. Line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment � criss-crossing 2 big strips will give you the neatest corners. Using a big, sharp knife and a ruler � or the base of your tin if it is removable � trim one pastry sheet to a shade under a 20cm square, so it will sit inside the tin, almond-side down. Spread over the custard as evenly as you can. Trim the second pastry sheet in the same way, but then divide the square into eight 10 x 5cm rectangles (so it will be easier when you cut the slices later). Sit them on top of the custard, almond side up, putting them back together a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Gently press down on the pastry so it doesn�t break but sticks to the custard, then cover and chill for 4 hrs or so, but better still overnight.
14. To serve, lift the slice from the tin and cut all the way through where the pastry top is already cut. Dust the slices with a little more icing sugar and serve. Best eaten within 24 hours, when the pastry is still good and crisp.

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/.
2. Roll the pastry out on a floured surface to a rectangle of about 48x32cm/19x12�in and bash the pastry with the rolling pin a bit. Puff pastry is made of fine layers and normally you have to be very delicate with it. For sausage rolls the pastry needs to be slightly puffed, but not too much, so bashing it with a rolling pin reduces the amount it puffs up.
3. Cut the large rectangle in half lengthways, then cut both smaller rectangles into eight equal sections. You now have 16 rectangles in total. Brush one end of each rectangle with a little of the beaten egg, lay a piece of sausage at the other end, then season the sausage with salt and freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Roll the sausage up in the pastry to enclose and repeat with all the sausages. Put the sausage rolls in the fridge for 20 minutes for the pastry to harden.
4. Once the pastry is hard, remove the sausage rolls from the fridge and score the tops with a sharp knife for decoration, or prick with a fork. Brush well all over with the rest of the beaten egg and bake in the oven for 25�30 minutes, or until the pastry has turned golden-brown and looks crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly before serving.

Instructions:
 Puffs
1. Place water, butter, and a pinch of salt in a pot. Then bring to a boil.
2. Stop the heat, sift in flour, and mix well until combined.
3. Put on medium heat, knead the dough by spreading it onto the bottom of the pot for 1 minute. When the dough cleanly comes away from the sides of the pot, turn off the heat.
4. Mix in the beaten eggs little by little, until the dough slowly drops off from the spatula and the remaining dough hangs down and forms a triangular shape.
5. Preheat the oven to 190C (374F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit a pastry bag with a big round tip, and fill with the dough. Pipe out the dough in 5cm (2inch) circles.
6. With a fork (or your finger) dipped in water, lightly press the dough to make them rise evenly.
7. Bake at 190C (374F) for about 30 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Stop the heat and leave them in the oven to cool down slowly in the oven for 10 minutes so that they won't shrink. Then leave to cool completely (on the baking sheet is ok).
 Vanilla Ice-Cream
1. Beat 2 whole eggs in a bowl.
2. Heat granulated sugar and water in a saucepan by tilting the pan. Then simmer until the liquid gets syrupy and the bubbles get larger. Make sure you don't brown the syrup, then stop the heat. (Do not mix it with a spoon but tilt the pan to mix it. The sugar will recrystallize if you mix it with a spoon.) 
3. Add the hot syrup (little by little if you can) in the beaten eggs, then immediately beat with an electric mixer until white and fluffy. *the syrup sterilizes and removes the egg smell and helps beat the eggs fluffy.
4. Combine whipping cream and vanilla extract in a dry, clean bowl. Float the bottom of the bowl in ice water, whisk the cream until it forms a stiff peak.
5. Add the whipped cream into the egg mixture and cut through the mixture with wire whisk or a spatula until combined.
6. Fit a pastry bag with a small round tip, and fill with the cream. Pipe the cream into the bottom of choux pastry.
7. Freeze until firm.

Instructions:
1. For chocolate filling, in a medium-sized heatproof bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt. 
2. Then whisk in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of the milk to make a thick paste. 
3. Add the egg yolks and whisk into the cocoa paste mixture. 
4. Set aside while you heat the milk and cream. Have ready a strainer placed over a bowl as you will need to strain the pudding after it is cooked.
5. Pour the remaining 1 1/3 cups (320 ml) milk with the cream into a medium-sized heavy saucepan. 
6. Bring this mixture just to a boil (the milk will start to foam up) and then remove from heat. Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the pudding mixture to a clean, heavy bottomed medium sized saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of mayonnaise (about 3 - 5 minutes). Remove from heat and pour through the strainer to remove any lumps that may have formed during cooking. Add the finely chopped chocolate, vanilla extract, and butter, stirring gently with a rubber spatula until the mixture is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap, to prevent a skin from forming, let cool, and then chill in the refrigerator until thick (for at least four hours, or even overnight).
7. For crust, lightly butter a 9 inch (23 cm) pie or tart pan.
8. In your food processor, place the flour, sugar, and salt and process to combine. 
9. Add the cold butter and pulse until the pastry starts to come together and form clumps. 
10. Transfer the pastry to your pie or tart pan and, using your fingertips, evenly press the pastry onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan.

12. Bake the pie for about 20 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 175C/350F. 
13. Continue to bake the pie for about 35-45 minutes or until the crust is a deep golden brown color and the juices are bubbling and thick. 
14. If the edges of the pie are browning too much during baking, cover with a foil ring. 
15. Place the baked pie on a wire rack to cool for several hours. 
16. For lemon filling, place the egg yolks in a medium sized heatproof bowl and set aside. 
17. Then, in a heavy bottomed saucepan whisk the sugar with the salt and corn flour. 
18. Gradually pour in the boiling water, whisking constantly. 
19. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, whisking or stirring constantly, bring just to a low boil. 
20. Adjust the heat and continue to cook the mixture for a minute or two or until thick and translucent. 
21. Remove from heat and whisk a little of the hot mixture into the egg yolks (to temper the yolks). 
22. Then whisk the egg yolks back into the hot mixture. 
23. Return the saucepan to the heat and cook, on medium low heat, stirring constantly, until  the mixture just reaches a low boil. 
24. Adjust heat and cook for a few minutes (until you see large breaking bubbles) to cook the egg yolks. 
25. Remove from heat and whisk, or stir, in the butter and lemon juice. 
26. If there are any lumps in your filling, strain. 
27. Then immediately cover with plastic wrap (to prevent a skin from forming) while you make the meringue.
28. For meringue, in a heatproof bowl (preferably stainless steel) whisk the egg whites with the sugar and cream of tartar. 
29. Place over a saucepan of simmering water and, whisking or stirring constantly, heat the egg whites until the sugar has melted and the mixture is hot (71C/160F) as this is the temperature that kills the risk of salmonella). 
30. Remove from heat and transfer the egg whites to your mixing bowl fitted with the whisk attachment (can use a hand mixer). 
31. Beat the whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. 
32. Beat in the vanilla extract.
33. Finally, pour the warm lemon filling into your prebaked pie crust and smooth the top with the back of your spoon or an offset spatula. 
34. Then, using two spoons, place large spoonfuls of the meringue on top of the filling. 
35. Start at the outside edge of your pie making sure the meringue touches the crust. 
36. Gently press down on the meringue to remove any air bubbles. If desired, make swirls in the meringue with the back of your spoon.
37. Then place the pie under a hot broiler (or you can use a hand held propane torch) until the meringue has browned. Watch carefully as it can burn very quickly.
38. Let the pie rest at room temperature for an hour to two so the filling has time to set. 
39. Serve or you can place it, uncovered, in the refrigerator until serving time if you prefer a chilled pie.

Instructions:

1. For pie crust, place the flour, salt, and sugar in the food processor and process until combined.  
2. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal (about 15 seconds). 
3. Pour in water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. 
4. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.
5. Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Flatten dough into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. 
6. After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface. 
7. Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).) 
8. Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. 
9. Place the assembled pie back in the refrigerator to chill for about 30 minutes.  
10. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. 
11. Remove the chilled pie from the fridge and place on a larger baking pan, lined with parchment paper, to catch any spills. 
12. Bake the pie for about 20 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 175C/350F. 
13. Continue to bake the pie for about 35-45 minutes or until the crust is a deep golden brown color and the juices are bubbling and thick. 
14. If the edges of the pie are browning too much during baking, cover with a foil ring. 
15. Place the baked pie on a wire rack to cool for several hours. 
16. For the cream cheese filling, whisk the cream cheese and process until smooth. 
17. Add sugar and process until incorporated. 
18. Add the eggs and process until thoroughly combined. 
19. Add remaining ingredients and process until well blended and smooth.
20. Carefully pour the filling into the pre-baked tart shell. 
21. Arrange the fresh strawberries evenly in the filling and then bake the tart for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the filling is set (test by gently shaking the pan). 
22. Transfer tart to wire rack to cool. 
23. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold. Cover and refrigerate leftovers.
